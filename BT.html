<p style="font-size:30;color:navy;font-weight:bold;font-family:calibri;text-decoration:underline;"> What is The Study of Biotechnology </p>
<pre style="font-size:18px;color:navy;font-weight:bold;font-family:calibri;">
With the development of genetic engineering in the 1970s,
 research in biotechnology (and other related areas such as medicine, biology etc.)
 developed rapidly because of the new possibility to make 
changes in the organisms' genetic material (DNA).

Today, biotechnology covers many different disciplines
 (eg. genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, etc.). New
 technologies and products are developed every year
 within the areas of eg. medicine (development of 
new medicines and therapies), agriculture 
(development of genetically modified plants, biofuels, biological treatment) 
or industrial biotechnology 
(production of chemicals, paper, textiles and food).

<p style="font-size:30;color:navy;font-weight:bold;font-family:calibri;text-decoration:underline;"> Why Study Biotechnology </p>
<pre style="font-size:18px;color:navy;font-weight:bold;font-family:calibri;">
nformation in animals so that human diseases can 
be modeled and studied. Biotechnology is both a 
basic and an applied science. These technologies are 
applied in agriculture, health care, forensics, 
industrial processing, and environmental management 
in many useful ways.
